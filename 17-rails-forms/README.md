# Learning Goals
- Why Rails?
  - making it easy for us to put code on the internet
  - tools and helpers to let us type less
- Why Capybara?
  - because we have to
  - to punish students
  - a cute animal ruined forever
  - integration tests
    - instead of just testing one thing (unit) capybabra is testing how our mvc work together
  - What does Capybara want from us?
    - can't find ....
    - looking for specifics: html element id or name matching a string in the test
- use Rails Generators help to make files your app needs
  - models => `rails g model fruits name:string`
    - model, migration
  - controllers => `rails g controller fruit`
    - controller
  - resources => `rails g resource fruits name:string`
    - model, migration, controller, routes, views directory
  - `rails d #{generator_name}` when mistake
- Rails form helpers return strings or html we need to make forms
  - form_for
    - requires instances and interacts with their attributes
    - uses the instance to decide where to send information
    - assumes the most for you and builds the most
    - best used with resources you are saving to your DB
  - form tag
    - does less for you, but allows more customization
    - best used with instances that aren't persisted
- Strong params
  - Rails is giving us extra protection from injection
  - data cannot be used for mass assignment in create/update unless params are specifically permitted
