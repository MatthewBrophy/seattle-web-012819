# CLI Starter Scaffold

Hello and welcome to the makings of your Ruby CLI!

We've provided you with the basic setup for a CLI using ActiveRecord. That means your basic gems and rake tasks are included in your Gemfile and Rakefile, respectively. In addition, we've included some other useful tidbits, so please be sure to take a tour of all the files and read all the comments we've left for you!

Play around! Poke around! The world is your oyster!
