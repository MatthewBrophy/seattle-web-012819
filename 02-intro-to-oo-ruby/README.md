Intro to Object Orientation
===========================

aka: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## SWBATs

* [x] Define `object` in programming domain
* [x] Explain the concept of sending messages
* [x] Create a class and instantiate an instance of the class
* [x] Explain the difference between a class and an instance
* [x] Pass arguments to `new` by defining an initialize method in class
* [x] Create instance methods
* [ ] Call methods on the implicit or explicit `self`
* [x] Define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros
* [ ] Get more practice with array compositions (`each`, `map`, `select`, `find`)
* [ ] Explain the need for variable scope and why it's important to not utilize global variables



### Objects!

- real world (attributes, methods)
  - organizing information, abstraction
- in programming (type, value of objects)
- Everything is an object
- methods: how do they work?
    - messages, send, respond, do work
- unknown methods? what happens?

### Objects, Classes, and Instances, Oh My!

- programmers are lazy
- hashes to classes, encapsulation
- class, objects, and instances: how are they related?
- `object_id`

### Creating our own Objects

- getters and setters
- instance variables, instance methods, scoping
- `attr_` macros, initialize
- more instance methods
  - implicit `self`
- class methods, class variables
  - `@@all`, `self`
  - how do we write `Human.all`?

### Practice with Iterators

- using `Class.all`
